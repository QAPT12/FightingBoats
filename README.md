# FightingBoats
Final project for Server Side Programming - building a Battleships style game

# Objective
The objective of this exercise is to create an opponent that can play the game of Battleships.
Game play.

In the Battleship game, each player secretly deploys a fleet of five ships:
1. a Carrier (5 spaces),
2. a Battleship (4 spaces),
3. a Cruiser (3 spaces),
4. a Submarine (3 spaces), and
5. a Destroyer (2 spaces),
   
in a square grid ocean, usually 10 x 10. Then each player takes turns guessing where a ship might be by
announcing a grid square and the opponent replying 'hit', 'miss', 'sunk', or 'defeated'. When all spaces
that a ship occupied are hit, the ship is sunk. The winner is the first player to sink all the opponent's ship.
